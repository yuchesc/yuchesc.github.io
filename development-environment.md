# My Development Environment

## Programing

### Intelli-J (Ultimate)

Mainly I use it for Scala (Play Framework).

Others: Python3, PHP, javascript, Stylus, HTML, etc...

### emacs

Rst-mode is the best for writing reStructuredText of all, for now.

Org-mode for GTD is also useful.

## 3D

### Blender

Still leaning, but it's very powerful and free.

## 2D

### GIMP

I like free software.

## PC

### MacBook Pro 13

For work.

### Alienware 15 Supreme
